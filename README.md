GateChain is a novel next-generation public blockchain, focused on onchain asset safety and decentralized exchange. 

## Installation Script
We have a installer script (install.sh) that takes care of chain directory setup. This uses the following defaults:

* Executable file is located at "/usr/local/bin"(that is:"gated" "gatecli")

```cassandraql
